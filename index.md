Welcome! This page covers quick help and how to reach us.

## Frequently Asked
### How do I use Catspace?
Open the app and allow **Camera** (for new photos) or **Photos** (to pick from your library).
Tap **Detect →**
* **Camera:** point at the cat and tap the shutter.
* **Photos:** choose a cat image from your library.

Our AI model identifies the breed and shows confidence plus Kitty’s Profile.
Results are auto-saved to **History** for revisiting or sharing later.

### Tips for best accuracy
* Fill the frame with the cat; avoid backlight and motion blur.
* Use one cat per photo.
* Try a different angle if “No cat detected”.

### What does Catspace Pro include?
* Unlimited detections
* Ad-free experience
* Early access to new features

Pricing varies by region and currency and is shown in-app.

### How do I restore my Pro subscription?
On the same Apple ID used for purchase:
1.  Open Catspace → **Settings** → **Upgrade to CATSPACE PRO** → **Restore Purchases**.
2.  Open Catspace → **Detect** → **PRO** → **Restore Purchases**.

**If restore fails**
* Confirm you’re signed into the same Apple ID.
* Check your internet connection and try again.
* Still stuck? Email us with device model, iOS version, and approximate purchase date.

Benefits remain until the current billing period ends.

### What permissions does the app request, and why?
* **Network Access** – To connect to our servers for AI breed detection, fetch ads for free users, and validate Pro subscription status.
* **Camera** – capture cat photos for detection.
* **Photos** – pick cat photos and (if you choose) save results back to your library.
* **Tracking (ATT)** – optional; used only to show personalized ads. **Pro** users see no ads.

Change permissions anytime in **Settings → Privacy & Security**.

### What happens to my photos?
Detection images are processed and discarded immediately after inference.
Nothing is stored on our servers unless you explicitly submit a feedback image to help improve accuracy (those are stored securely and can be deleted on request).

See the full policy: [https://wonky-wombat.github.io/Catspace-Policies/privacy-policy](https://wonky-wombat.github.io/Catspace-Policies/privacy-policy).

### “No cat detected” or wrong breed—what can I do?
* Use a brighter photo, move closer, center the cat.
* Keep it to one cat per image.
* If a result looks off, submit **Feedback** from Kitty’s Profile (attach the image and correct breed if known).

### Why is detection slow or failing?
* Check your network; some enhancements may contact our server.
* Force-quit and reopen the app, then try a new photo.
* Ensure you’re on the latest app and iOS versions.

### I hit a daily limit—what does that mean?
Free users have a small daily detection limit to control costs.

It resets every 24 hours. **Pro** removes the limit and all ads.
